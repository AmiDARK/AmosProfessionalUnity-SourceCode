# AmosProfessionalUnity-SourceCode

You will find in this repository the entire source code of AMOS Professional UNITY.
This source-code is published under the MIT licence, which means you can do anything you want from it as long as the copyright notice is present in both the modified source code and the boot screen of the application. Contrary to the initial François Lionet Repository, the application was updated to mention both official François Lionet's Amos Professional repository, and Amos Professional UNITY repository.

This distribution is based on the repository created by marc365. https://github.com/marc365/AMOSProfessional
Thank you Marc365 for your work creating a compilable version of the Amos Professional source code!
I have included parts of your readme after this intro.

As explained here : https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/317041/should-i-add-the-license-in-every-header-and-source-file#:~:text=1%20Answer&text=This%20is%20an%20old%20question,included%20with%20the%20source%20code.
The MIT License only requires that the license text available here : https://mit-license.org/ 
be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This mean that the License.txt available in the repository fit the MIT license requirements.

This repository is 68k Assembly and was entirely restructured. It will be really different from the original François Lionet or Marc365 repositories..
Files names are now more talkative and organized by categories. It is better for developer teams as some files were explosed in parts to make updates easier by development teams.
It is powerful and runs like an operating system. Games and multimedia become exciting to program again, relying on your own skills instead of libraries.

This release is as-is and doesn't contain any installation or demos.
However, I have commented many parts of Amos Professional source code. It may be really useful for those that wants to learn how Amos Professional Internally works.


# AMOS Professional

based on the original 68000 source code by François Lionet (Thank you!)


# History
Some years ago there was discussion of re-development, but the work mentioned in [this article](http://www.amiworld.it/news/amos_upgrade_eng.html) was not made public, any collaborative efforts have disappeared. An archive was made available at a later date but was partially incomplete and difficult to build - this project fixes the build problems, but has no relation to any previous plans or news releases.


# AMOS PRO goes Public Domain!

> [01 dec 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20130530022407/http://www.pianetaamiga.it)
In occasion of Pianeta Amiga 2012, Pietro Ghizzoni, current owner of AMOS Pro sources after Francois Lionet ceased development, has kindly agreed to release them as Public Domain. You can download the full package in advance from this link. Sources will be also put on Aminet in the next days.

François said that Amos Professional source code was Adandoned and is now under MIT License.

François Lionet decide to put Amos Professional License under GPLv3 terms. The Amos Professional AGA (The X Project) is then canceled

> [26 apr 2020](https://github.com/AOZ-Studio/AMOS-Professional-Official)
François Lionet, finally decided to drop the idea to use LGPL v3 licence terms for the Amos Professional source code and came back to his initial choice of MIT License.
With this final decision, I decided to restart the Amos Professional AGA (The X Project).


# AMOS present and future

Amos Professional did get good improvements during 2019. These improvements added partial but interesting support for the AGA chipset.
With recent minding about future, I decided to restart the project in a more flexible way. It is now called "Amos Professional Unity".
The Amos Professional AGA (The X Project) is now stopped in its current shape/form. A new project is born and will replace the Amos Professional AGA (The X Project).
2021 should be the year of the Amos Professional Unity projet.
The official ["Amos Professional AGA (The X Project)"](http://amos-professional-aga.frederic-cordier.fr/?amos-professional-aga-x-version) mini website will be maintened to receive now updates for the "Amos Professional Unity" project.
Regards,
AmiDARK
