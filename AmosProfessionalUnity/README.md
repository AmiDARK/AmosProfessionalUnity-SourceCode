# About AMOS Professional X for AGA support.
> The project that did initially takes the name "Amos Professional X" was stopped. With the official release of Amos Professional under MIT Licence, I have reopened this project.
After some works on it, I decided to stop this form of the project and to release the source code : https://github.com/AmiDARK/Amos-Professional-X-Source-Code-Official

# About AMOS Professional Unity.

> Amos Professional Unity is the new project I work on, concerning Amos Professional. It's a complete reshape of Amos Professional, taking benefits of changes I did on the Amos Professional X, but with a more robust and precise structure. It allow a more flexible behaviour and the capability to keep compatibility with original Amos Professional 2.0 while adding new functionalities and enhancements for AGA graphic chipset, and SAGA graphic and audio chipsets. The project is currently "Work In Progress".

> I have much respect about the huge amount of work François did to create AMOS and AMOS Professional but, for the moment, and in respect to the MIT Licence terms capabilities (source : https://github.com/Francaoz/AMOS-Professional-Official/blob/master/LICENSE seen in the GitHub box about MIT Licence "A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code." ) and not restricted by licence information added by François, I consider that improving AMOS Professional with AGA support is a larger work as it require me to makes many changes in many components of the AMOS Professional engine (copper list, sprites, bob, iff/ilbm, load/save datas, internal structures, etc.).<br>
With these, I prefer not release the source code for the moment.<br>
Source code will probably be released for "educational purposes" when the project will be finished.

François Lionet MIT Licence is available in this project, in the file Licence.txt
The Amos Professional Unity (X2 version) project is currently distribued under MIT License with Closed source until the project reach its end.

Frédéric Cordier
