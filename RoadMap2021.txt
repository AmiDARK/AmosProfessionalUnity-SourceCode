Here is the official roadmap for ending 2020 and 2021 concerning the brand new project "Amos Professional Unity" based on Official Fran√ßois Lionet Amos Professional.
This road map will show the step I have in mind to achieve to main goal



Goal : Makes Amos Professional being able to support graphics/audio multi-platform for 68k compatible Amiga Hardwares
; **************************************************************************************************************
Step 1 : Rebuild a flexible Amos Professional Version from the original
X 1.1 Rebuild Amos Professional source code Structure to fit requirements for new flexible files structures
X 1.2 Makes the default Amos Professional uses AmosProUnityECS.library instead of AMOS.library
X 1.3 Modify internal source code to use the new library name AmosProUnityECS.library
X 1.4 Update configuration files for compiler, interpreter, editor to uses new AmosProUnity config files instead of the older ones.

Step 2 : Push everything that was graphic dependant into the new AmosProUnityECS.library
- 2.1 Put all methods that requires graphic treatment inside the AMOS.library (iff, pack/unpack, etc. )
      2.1.1 Load Iff / Anim
      2.1.2 compact.lib Pack/unpack
      2.1.3 Check if Open Screen handle graphic chipset specific values and mode it if required.
      2.1.4 Update Colour method to handle 24 bits by using $FF000000 at beginning of color
      2.1.5 Update Rainbow method to handle 24 bits by using $FF000000 at beginning of color
- 2.2 Update Amos Professional internal structures to handle data for all hardware variants planed.
      2.2.1 Push up to 10 bitplanes.
- 2.3 Reinject specific Color Palette support to flexible format support (can handle 8/16/32 Bits colors)
      2.3.1 Aga color palette method to create/delete/load/save IFF/ILBM Color Palettes in 32 bits RGB
      2.3.2 Rainbow Load/Save system
- 2.4 Check that the Amos Professional Unity internal structure is adapted to changes

; **************************************************************************************************************

Step 3 : Reimplement the AGA methods inside the AmosProUnityAGA.library
- 3.1 Reimport all the changes applied into the AmosProAGA.library inside the new AmosProUnityAGA.library
- 3.2 Makes Amos Professional detect chipsets ECS/AGA and open the correct library AmosProUnityECS.library or AmosProUnityAGA.library depending on configuration
- 3.3 Check that the Amos Professional Unity internal structure is adapted to changes for all the supported platforms

Step 4 : Complete the AmosProUnityAGA.library AGA support
- 4.1 Add support for AGA rainbows (modify current rainbows to switch to ECS/AGA version of the methods using a flag)
- 4.2 Add support for AGA sprites

Step 5 : Implement the SAGA methods inside the AmosProUnitySAGA.library
- 5.1 Makes Amos Professional detecte Chipet SAGA and open the correctly ECS, AGA or SAGA AmosProUnity***.library depending on configuration
- 5.2 Add support for Chunky screen
- 5.3 Add support for chunky graphics (get image, paste image, etc...)
- 5.3 Add support for PIP Screen
- 5.4 Add support for SAGA Sprites
- 5.2 -
- 5.3 Check that the Amos Professional Unity internal structure is adapted to changes for all the supported platforms

Step 6 : Multi-platform coding support
- 6.1 Implement methods for platform dependant code that allow to setup things for each configuration allowing 1 .exe file to run and take benefit of each configuration.
- 6.2 Add ECS Chunky screen support
- 6.3 Add AGA Chunky screen support
- 6.4 






To Emulate V4 STAND ALONE Chunky screen, I'll use a C2P routine on Amiga 500 / 1200
https://aminet.net/package/dev/asm/1Seb_FAST_C2P for 68020/68030 and 68040/68060.
